# Machine Learning

Notes from Machine Learning Nanodegree program

* What is Machine Learning

    Machine Learning corresponds to evaluating some data and making predictions
    - Problems 
    - Tools (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Neural networks, etc)
    - Measurement Tools - Metrics and technqiues to evaluate the algorithms and parameters, identify the one that's best for the problem.

* Training and Testing Models

* Evaluation Metrics

    - Confusion Matrix
    - Accuracy Score
    - Precision and Recall
    - F1 score
    - F-beta score
    - ROC Curve
    - Regression Metrics
    
* Model Selection


Process:

- Load the data
- Train test split data
- Instantiate the Model (DecisionTree, LogisticsRegression, etc)
- Fit the model to train data
- Make predictions with test data
- Calculate accuracy score
